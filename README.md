# Hamilton Overtakes Everyone At The 2021 Brazilian GP!

**Introduction**

The 2021 Brazilian Grand Prix was one of the most exciting races to ever exist in Formula 1 history. All the fun started when Hamilton was disqualified from qualifying for a technical rule infringement. The flap was first analysed by Verstappen, who was later handed a â‚¬50,000 fine. Sprint became one of the most anticipated events of the weekend, with all types of chaos happening. During the sprint, nothing much happened except Hamilton carrying the race by passing more than half of the field in only 24 laps around the Interlagos track. Hamilton finished in the top five, making it one of the most exciting sprint races in Formula One history. The following day was the time to race.

**Race Day**

When the Brazilian Grand Prix started, Max Verstappen had the lead into turn 1 as he was on the inner lane of the track. Hamilton started from 10th as there was an ICE change. The race was going well, with Hamilton once again showing great pace by overtaking most of the decent drivers on track. His pace was so strong that he was able to get into the podium places in just a few laps. Tactics were becoming more crucial as the tyres got worn out. Hamilton did not want to give any information to any other teams, so he decided to inform his team about his tyres with a strange code, which was definitely crucial for his win that day. 

During one of the most intense laps, Hamilton was closing in on Verstappen, and he had a significant straight-line speed difference compared to Verstappen. Then there was a controversy in which Hamilton was pushed wide by Verstappen. Verstappen was not handed any penalties. Hamilton expressed his dissatisfaction over the radio to his team. The very next lap, Hamilton was able to force Verstappen into the inner lane of the track into turn 1, which sacrificed his corner exit. Hamilton was able to benefit from it quite significantly, as he overtook Verstappen early on the straights with the aid of DRS, which made him pull away from Verstappen even further. The move made by Hamilton was crucial, as it rewarded him with a win. What a race it was for Hamilton!
